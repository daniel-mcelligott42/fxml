This is the final version of my project.
I kept getting an error about one of my modules and as a result i couldn't run the application correctly, i spent hours trying to get around this but felt i was getting nowhere with it.
I think i was also getting away from the point of the project.
I got an interface working with two fields and a sign up button.
The usertest file was my TDD, i first made the tests and then after made the methods in the user file to pass the tests
They worked for all the email and password requirements.
